## üöÄ Running the Applications

### 1. Emotion Detection

Utilizes DeepFace for real-time emotion recognition.

```bash
python Emotion_Detection.py
```

### 2. Face Mesh Detection

Leverages MediaPipe for detecting facial landmarks.

```bash
python Face_Detection.py
```

### 3. Sign Language  Detection

Leverages MediaPipe for detecting Sign Language .

```bash
python Sign_lang_Detection.py
```

### 4. Hand Distance From Camera Detection

Leverages MediaPipe for detecting Hand Distance from camera.

```bash
python Hand_Distance.py
```

> Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Not Detected:**
  - Ensure no other application is using the webcam.
  - Check if the correct camera index is used in the script.

- **Slow Performance:**
  - Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources.
  - Consider reducing the resolution of the video feed in the script.

- **Module Import Errors:**
  - Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
  - Reinstall the requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
    ```
