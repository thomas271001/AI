## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 1. 📷 Simple Face Detection

A beginner-friendly application that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect faces in real-time from webcam video.

- ✅ Real-time webcam face detection
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast
- 🔲 Face bounding box overlay

### 2. 😊 Emotion Detection

This project uses deep learning to recognize human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from facial expressions in real time.

- 🎯 Trained on FER-2013 dataset
- 🧠 CNN-based emotion classification
- 📊 Outputs emotion label and confidence score
